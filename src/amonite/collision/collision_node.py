    Attributes
    ----------
    velocity_x: float
        X component of the collider's velocity vector.
    velocity_y: float
        X component of the collider's velocity vector.
    active_tags: list[str]
        Tags provided to others on collision (self->other).
    passive_tags: list[str]
        Tags provided to others on collision (other->self).
    type: CollisionType
        The type of collision to implement: DYNAMIC collisions are always tested against STATIC ones.
    method: CollisionMethod
        The method for computing collisions: ACTIVE collisions are computed by exhausting the collider's velocity, while PASSIVE collisions are computed by mere intersection checking, no velocity involved.
        Typically ACTIVE colliders are used to control other objects' movement, while PASSIVE colliders are controlled by other objects' movement.
    sensor: bool
        Whether or not the collider should be used as a sensor or not. If True, the collider does not "physically" collide with others, but still registers overlaps as collisions.
    shape: CollisionShape
        The collision shape that defines the collider: all collisions are computed against the provided collision shape.
    on_triggered: Callable[[list[str], int, bool], None] | None
        Callback for handling collision events. This is called every time the collider enters or exits another.
        Takes three parameters: a list of collision tags, the object id of the other collider and whether the collision is beginning (entering) or ending (exiting).
    collisions: set[CollisionNode]
        The list of all colliders self is currently colliding with.
    in_collisions: set[CollisionNode]
        The list of all just entered colliders self is colliding with.
    out_collisions: set[CollisionNode]
        The list of all just exited colliders self is colliding with.
